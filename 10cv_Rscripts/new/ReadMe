seq-wo-mri: sequential model not adding mri

seq-mri-outcone: sequential model adding mri as an outcome (main effect of mri on cancer)

seq-mri-moderator: sequential model adding mri as a moderator (no main effect of mri, mri is added in the biopsy model to moderate the accuracy of biopsy in predicting cancer); 1(bgg
>1) ~ ... + 1(eta>=2)*1(has mri)

seq-mri-both: sequential model with mri both as an outcome and moderator
